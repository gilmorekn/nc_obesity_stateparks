## 2022 North Carolina Percent Adult Obedisity Prevelance in realtion to State Park Locations
### The Metrics
The Adult Obesity Prevelance for North Carolina is calculated from The County Health Rankings, a collaboration between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, measuring the health of nearly all counties in the nation and rank them within states using using county-level measures from a variety of national and state data sources provided by ArcGIS Online

### Recommended for 
This map would be useful for assessing both the counties with the highest prevelance of adult obesity and the North Carolina State Park distributions. Furthermore, one could use this map to assess whether there may be a relationship between the prevelance of adult abilsity and population distance and accessibility to State Parks and State Park Recreation areas. Community Health Advocacy leaders may implement programs promoting State Park use in geographic areas where a State Park is accessible but obesisty prevelance remains high. 

### Functions
Feature functions include a visually appealing color ramp of 5 classes to represent county Health Factor rankings reflecting adult obesity prevelance percentages from greatest to least. A user may also click on a State Park icon, indicated by a tree, to learn the name of the State Park or Recreation area. 


### Data Sources
ArcGIS Online geoJson file was used for NC county boundary and obesity prevelance polygon layer. CartoDB Light_all basemap was applied from Leaflet Providers. NC State Park and Recreation data was generated through NC Division of Parks and Recreation at NCParks.gov. The fa-solid fa-tree icon was obtained from font-awesome library 6.4.0. 5-class color ramp was applied from chroma.scale.
